# Separate haplotypes with toulbar2

Given a genome assembly in fasta format and a set of proteins from the same or a closely related species also in fasta format and the awaited ploitdy, our python script will align the proteins onto the genome, produce a protein to contig link file, transform the link file in a contraint file, resolve the contraints with toolbar2 and extract the haplotyped contigs lists in separate haplotype fasta files.

Dependencies 
- miniprot (https://github.com/lh3/miniprot)
- toulbar2 (https://github.com/toulbar2/toulbar2)
